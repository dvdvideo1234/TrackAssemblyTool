   * Create a table and populate it as shown below

   * and then for every active point, you must have one array of
   * strings and numbers, where the elements match the following data settings.
   * {TYPE, LINEID, NAME}
   * TYPE   > This is the category under your physical properties are stored internally.
   *          It is mandatory and taken in pairs with LINEID, it forms the unique identifier of every record.
   *          When used in /DSV/ mode ( like seen below ) is is used as a hash index.
   * LINEID > This is the ID of the point that can be selected for building. They must be
   *          sequential and mandatory. If provided, the ID must the same as the row index under
   *          a given model key. Disabling this, makes it use the the index of the current line.
   *          Use that to swap the active points around by only moving the desired row up or down.
   *          For the example table definition below, the line ID in the database will be the same.
   * NAME   > This stores the name of the physical property. It must an actual physical property.
