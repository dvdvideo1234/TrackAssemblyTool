[h1] Description [/h1]
This script can give you the ability to connect prop-segmented track pieces fast. It is optimized and brings the track building time consuming to a minimum. It uses pre-defined active points to snap the segments the best way there is in Garry's Mod

If the tool database does not seem to be correct please reset the external
DSV by deleting the [url=https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/TrackAssemblyTool/tree/master/data/trackassembly]data/trackassembly[/url] folder!
Please remember to backup your personal pluggable DSV database if you have created any!
The DSV database is located in the [url=https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/TrackAssemblyTool/tree/master/data/trackassembly/dsv]data/trackassembly/dsv[/url] folder!

Reuploading and source stealing will not be tolerated !
Selling it is also out of option, as the open source suggests !
