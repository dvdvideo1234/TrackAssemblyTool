     * /!<attachment_name>/ and it depends what attachment name you gave it when you

     *          sequential and mandatory. If provided, the ID must the same as the row index under
     *          a given model key. Disabling this, makes it use the the index of the current line.
     *          Use that to swap the active points around by only moving the desired row up or down.
     *          For the example table definition below, the line ID in the database will be the same.
     * POINT  > This is the local position vector that TA searches and selects the related

     * ANGLE  > This is the angle relative to which the forward and up vectors are calculated.
     *          An empty string is treated as {0,0,0}. Disabling this also makes it use {0,0,0}
